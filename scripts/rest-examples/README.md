# REST API examples

This folder contains `http` files with helpful example requests to try out the OAS API while developing.

It can be used with the [REST client](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) extension for VS code to edit and run these requests and see their responses.

Install the extension, then open a `.http` file. You should see `Send request` buttons for each request. Clicking it will execute the request and show the response in a new panel.

You can edit the variables to point at a different instance of Open Audio Search easily.
