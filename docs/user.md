# User Guide

The following paragraphs will outline the usage of Open Audio Search (*OAS*). This guide is directed towards users of the system and should help you get started easily. We intend to expand and improve this document over time. If something in here is unclear to you or you miss explanations, please feel invited to [open an issue](https://github.com/openaudiosearch/openaudiosearch/issues/new/choose).


## User Interface

The main page of *OAS* shows the `Discover` tab. It displays a sample of radio features from community media stations you might be curious about. These audio tracks, like many others, are indexed in the system and are therefore searchable through the search engine. Some basic information, such as *title*, *duration* and a short *description*, is already provided for every track in a box. If you want to get more information on a specific track, just click on its title to get to its detail view, which also includes the transcript. If you prefer to hear the audio track right away, just press the play button in the upper-right corner of the box.


### Search

As *OAS* is a search engine for audio data, one of its core features is to find specific words or terms in audio tracks. To accomplish such a search, you can use one of the search boxes in the title bar or on the frontpage. For more search options navigate to the `Search` tab and submit your query using the search box there. Results are displayed as boxes in the middle of the page and you can sort them by date of publication or duration. For each search result some basic information on the audio track is provided: the *radio station*, its *title*, *duration*, *date of publication*, as well as a short *description* of its content. But you'll also find snippets of the transcript where the search term was found. By clicking on the box around the snippet, you can jump right to the part of the audio track where the snippet was taken from. Of course you can also play the whole audio file from start by pressing the Play button in the upper-right corner of the box.

To fine-tune your search, you can use the search options (facets) on the left side of the page. You can filter the results by *creator*, *genre*, *publishing date* and/or *duration*. You can find examples on how to apply such search facets in the `How To...`-Section below.

In order to get more information on a specific track, including its transcript, just click on its title to get to its detail view. In the transcript, clicking on a word makes the audio player jump to the part of the track where it is mentioned.


### Login

To login as administrative user, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the `Login` button on the right. In the pop up window, fill in your *username* and *password* and hit `Login`.


## How To...

This section walks you through specific tasks you might want to accomplish:
